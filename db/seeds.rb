    Preheat the grill to medium-high heat, at 400°F:

    Clean and oil the grill grates.
    Make the brown sugar topping:

    In a small bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, and salt.  Set aside.
    Grill the peaches:

    Brush the cut side of the peaches with the melted butter. Place the peaches on the hot grill, cut side-down, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until you can see clear grill marks. The grill remains uncovered the whole time. Flip and cook them cut side-up for 2 minutes.
    Assemble and serve:

    To serve, place a grilled peach half on a plate and sprinkle 1/2 tablespoon brown sugar mixture on top while the peach is still warm. Top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Serve and enjoy!

    Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. To reheat the peaches, place them in a 350°F oven for 10 minutes or in the microwave for 1 minute. They are also great served cold! ",
